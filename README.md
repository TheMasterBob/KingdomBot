# KingdomBot
A bot on Discord. Build, raid, expand!

This needs the discord.js modules (version 11.2) and the SQLite module.

There's an official Discord server for KingdomBot at https://bit.ly/kingbotserver

KingdomBot can be invited at https://bit.ly/kingbot

Additionally, if you run the files here plain as they are, it won't work. For obvious reasons (I'm not letting you hack my bot, thanks) I've excluded the bot's token.

Work in progress.
