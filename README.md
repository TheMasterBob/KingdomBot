# KingdomBot
A bot on Discord. Build, raid, expand!

This needs the discord.js modules (version 11.2) and the SQLite module. Though I didn't put a license on it, so you shouldn't be running it for use that's not allowed under free use.

There's an official Discord server for KingdomBot at https://bit.ly/kingbot
