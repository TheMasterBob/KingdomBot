# KingdomBot
A bot on Discord. Build, raid, expand!

This needs the discord.js modules (version 11.2) and the SQLite module. Though I didn't put a license on it, so you shouldn't be running it for use that's not allowed under free use.

There's an official Discord server for KingdomBot at https://bit.ly/kingbot

Additionally, if you run the files here plain as they are, it won't work. For obvious reasons (I'm not letting you hack my bot, thanks) I've excluded the bot's token.
